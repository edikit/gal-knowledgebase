            <!--<p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>-->
			<hr />
            <p>You've signed up, added your locations, and are ready to start buying leads, but there aren't any avaialble in your area! What gives? Don't worry, this is just part of our process.</p>
			<p>We generate our leads in real time. What that means is that all of the leads that we have available for you are from people who have <b>just made contact</b>. We don't have any stale leads. In fact, if a lead hasn't been purchased within 5 days, we consider it a dead lead and remove it from our system. Most of them don't last that long though.</p>
			<h3>Where do your leads come from?</h3>
			<p>Our leads come from various networks, all of which cater to people looking specifically for your services. We tap into social media, mobile and desktop search, and other websites that are related to your industry. We display relavent ads in these networks and direct people to highly converting landing pages that speak to your offering.</p>
			<p>We'll alert you as soon as someone reaches out, which gives you immediate access to that lead's details.</p>
			<h3>How are you different from other lead providers?</h3>
			<p>Glad you asked. We're exremely proud of our lead generation model and stand behind the quality of our leads. Here are a few things that set us apart from other lead providers:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>We <u>do not</u> consider a random email address from a list a lead.</li>
			<li>We <u>do not</u> sell our leads to more than 1 company.</li>
			<li>We <u>do not</u> sell outdated leads.</li>
			<li>We provide qualifying lead information that you care about.</li>
			<li>We let you decide which leads you do or do not want to buy.</li>
			<li><b>On average, our leads convert 5x better than other providers.</b></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Because of this, our leads tend to be a bit more expensive than most shared lead providers. The difference is that you don't have to rely on volume to make a return on your investment.</p>
			<blockquote>A roofing contractor recently signed up for GrabALead and purchased 3 leads within two weeks. 2 of them closed and he was in the process of setting up an appointment with the third when he emailed us.</blockquote>
